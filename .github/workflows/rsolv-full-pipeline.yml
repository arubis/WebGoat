# TEMPLATE: RSOLV Full Security Pipeline (Scan → Validate → Mitigate)
#
# ADVANCED TEMPLATE - Full three-phase security automation
# Based on proven nodegoat deployment patterns
#
# QUICK START:
# 1. Copy to: .github/workflows/rsolv-full-pipeline.yml
# 2. Add secrets in Settings → Secrets → Actions:
#    - RSOLV_API_KEY: Your RSOLV API key
#    - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Your Anthropic API key (for AI-powered fixes)
# 3. Commit and push
#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
# Phase 1 (SCAN): Detect vulnerabilities, create GitHub Issues
# Phase 2 (VALIDATE): Use AST analysis to verify findings, reduce false positives
# Phase 3 (MITIGATE): Generate AI-powered fixes, create Pull Requests
#
# RUNTIME: 5-10 minutes total for all three phases

# CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
#
# Workflow Modes:
# - 'scan': Detect vulnerabilities only
# - 'validate': Verify detected issues with AST
# - 'mitigate': Generate fixes for validated issues
# - 'full': Run all phases in single job
#
# Common Parameters:
# - max_issues: Limit number of issues processed (reduce runtime)
# - issue_label: Filter issues by label
# - rsolvApiKey: RSOLV API key (required)
#
# Performance Tips:
# - Use max_issues to limit scope for demos/testing
# - Run phases independently for better control
# - Schedule weekly full scans, manual runs for specific issues
#
# Troubleshooting:
# - Workflow hangs: Update to v3.8.44+ (v3.6.x has bugs)
# - No issues created: Check RSOLV_API_KEY is set
# - Validation fails: Normal for some patterns, issues remain tagged
# - No PRs created: Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set
